**Fun Fact**:
If all the names in the world are written down together in order and you want to search for the position of a specific name, binary search will accomplish this in a maximum of 35 iterations.

As we dispose off one part of the search case during every step of binary search, and perform the search operation on the other half, this results in a worst case time complexity of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
